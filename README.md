# NEAR Smart Contracts
This repository contains the codebase of 2 independent smart contracts, hosted respectively in
- `contract-nft`: mint credit scores as NFTs
- `contract-storescore`: store credit scores to the NEAR blockchain
---

### :page_facing_up: Licences
This Git Repo is released under the Apache 2.0 open source license.
However, the codebase hosted under the directory `contract-nft` is regulated by the less rescrictive MIT Lincence. As such, we encourage developers to use such portion of the codebase entirely free of restrictions or limitations.

### :satellite: Purpose
The two smart contracts are completely independent from each other, but we decided to host them in the same Repo for simplicity. They are both written in Rust and are meant to be deployed to the Near Protocol blockchain. Our [BalloonBox](https://www.balloonbox.io/) team designed these contracts for a [NearOracle](https://test.nearoracle.com/), a dApp we built for the Near Foundation and its community.
